* Do we even need a database?
	- if not, do we need rust?
* env! didn't work on Linux:
	- should we just get rid of GNOS_USER?
* Firefox didnt work very well
	- might be the layout css
* Use saturated colors only for emphasis
	- even blue and green
* Don't use white for the background
* Seems to be a delay opening details window
	- might be related to poll interval
* Had problems restarting server on linux
	- maybe reuse addr related
	  rust: ~"Couldn\'t start web server at 10.4.0.3: bind failed to find an address"
* Make sure gnos works without --admin
* Use  autofocus="autofocus" in the query page
* Rust doesn't collect managed box cycles so rrdf memory usage is awful:
	- once rust fixes this need to verify that memory usage is stable
* It would be nice to support virtual networks better:
	- modeler could run on a virtual host
	- would have to do PUTs to a unique store
	- gnos home page would have to have a way to pick which store to show
* Support multiple networks
	- modelers need a --name argument
	- data goes into a store named using that name
	- gnos maintains an index store
	- home page shows entries in the index store
		modelers should add relations to a networks entity?
	- double click shows info for that store
	- need to time out entries in the index store
* If a lot of traffic is going over a link relation show it:
	- dashs or fatter lines
	- probably log scaled based on bandwidth and capacity
	- possible animation as well (might tie in better with NetFlow)
* Switch to using libuv.
* Need to enable smux in order to access quagga's MIBs
	- net-snmp must be built with --with-mib-modules=smux
	- quagga must be built with --enable-snmp
	- http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/docs/docs-info.html#SEC143
* Need an L2 option:
	- also snmp: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CFUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cisco.com%2Fen%2FUS%2Ftech%2Ftk648%2Ftk362%2Ftechnologies_tech_note09186a00801c9199.shtml&ei=KDAdUMWsBYOGyQHmpIDQDw&usg=AFQjCNG7O3ox230HFyYMKT6966T399Z8wg&sig2=F3LAXDBFGp4L1ZdXMfWsyQ
	- add dynamic entities for each VLAN, only shown if options.L2
	- add static entities for the switch, guess this is always shown
	- add static entity for the bridge and ttnt, show if options.L2
	- modeler will have to change up wiring when options.L2
	- switch will need snmp enabled
	dot1dTpFdbPort maps peer MACs to ports
	vmMembershipSummaryMemberPorts maps ports to VLANs
	vlanTrunkPortVlansEnabled maps VLANs to trunks
	ifPhysAddress MAC for the switch port
* A modeler should listen for generic traps and at least a few custom ones admins can add
	- standard generic traps are: coldStart, warmStart, linkDown, linkUp, authenticationFailure, egpNeighborLoss
	- net-snmp has fewer: http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial/tutorial-5/commands/snmptrap.html
	- net-snmp can be configured to send custom traps: http://serverfault.com/questions/248332/set-up-snmp-trap-for-disk-usage
* Start using cargo to fetch dependencies?
	- erickt's server does that
* net-modeler should be its own project
* Sliders and option dropdown values should be persisted in a pref:
	- use web storage?
	- not exactly clear when the prefs should be applied
	- set the pref when the associated value changes
	- use the pref when the associated widget is (re)initialized
* Would be nice to be able to show syslogs.
* Network files should support comments
	- will probably have to preprocess them
* Balloon layout is interesting:
	http://lab.kapit.fr/display/visualizationlayouts/Balloon+layout
* Add a details list for dropped packets:
	- ifInDiscards, ifInErrors, ifInUnknownProtos, ifOutDiscards, ifOutErrors
	- only show the details if one of these isn't zero
* Interesting wayts to connect html thingies:
	- http://jsplumb.org/doc/usage.html
	- http://js-graph-it.sourceforge.net/index.html
* Other maps
	- snmp
	- rust docs
	- rust project
	- rust compiler
	- rust web site
	- coco dashboard
	- programmig tips
* HTML5 has notifications:
	- http://www.paulund.co.uk/html5-notifications
	- still not widely supported
* Might be able to use web storage to store the data required to handle time-based replay
	- or have the server persist old snapshots
	- maybe last N (if someone is viewing them could retain them all)
* HTML5 apparently does support extending the browser's context menu:
	- <section contextmenu="mymenu">
	  <!-- 
	    For the purpose of cleanliness, 
	    I'll put my menu inside the element that will use it 
	  -->
	
	  <!-- add the menu -->
	  <menu type="context" id="mymenu">
	    <menuitem label="Refresh Post" onclick="window.location.reload();" icon="/images/refresh-icon.png"></menuitem>
	    <menu label="Share on..." icon="/images/share_icon.gif">
	      <menuitem label="Twitter" icon="/images/twitter_icon.gif" onclick="goTo('//twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=' + document.title + ':  ' + window.location.href);"></menuitem>
	      <menuitem label="Facebook" icon="/images/facebook_icon16x16.gif" onclick="goTo('//facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=' + window.location.href);"></menuitem>
	    </menu>
	  </menu>
	</section>
	- but it's not in chrome yet: http://caniuse.com/#search=contextmenu
* Should be able to support different dashboard styles:
	- operational: largely an easy to interpret view of network health
	- analysis: details on network behavior
	- could probably do this via inspectors, toggling stuff on shifts the view more towards analysis
* Add support for remotely running tools:
	- use a config file with tool name, default command line template, html description
	- description could summarize most important options and have a link to man page
	- ping, tcpdump, mping, mgen, traceroute
	- config probably also needs something for results, either display stdout or download file
* Would be nice to support more entity shapes: rect, oval, circle, none
* Semantic styles would allow user customization
* OpenOntologyRepository (OOR) and Xmdr
	- also can use swoogle to search for ontologies
* Make gnos a sparql endpoint?
	- note that there is a protocol for this
* Netflow:

* Make sure subject view puts an upper bound on displayed object length.
* Would be nice to style changed labels:
	- for the map client could probably do this
	- for details seems like server would have to
* May want to use deps directory
	- update-libraries eithe git clones/pulls or uses subtrees
	- check-all runs all unit tests
	- make defaults to building everything
* Probably should have a pref to control canvas size (maybe on the map inspector).
* Should validate the network.json file.
* Maybe allow people to do tcpdumps on device(s)
	- possibly use something like http://www.tcptrace.org/index.html views
* Make the licensing explicit
	- need to do this for other projects as well
* Might want an alert if ipForwarding is off and its a router
	- how do we know if its a router? quagga is running?
* What about icmp mib?
* Should be an alert if the server logs an #error.
* Alert if snmp-modeler takes to long to put:
	- either automatically or manually restart the script
* Might want to allows admins to create custom alerts:
	- data comes from a custom query
	- html comes from a template
* Quagga:
	- http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/docs/docs-info.html#SEC143
	   has lots of info on setting up quagga
	- http://www.net-track.ch/opensource/quagga-snmp/
	   patch for quagga to add snmp support to bdpd
* Examples:
	- zenoss
	- cacti
* Might need some sort of rdd database, see rrdtool
* Rmon
	- supports packet level stats
	- allows traps for stats that go above or below a threshold
* Syslog can be used to send logs elsewhere
* Next generation network management
	- http://books.google.com/books?id=9WWereKFb54C&dq=rdf+schema+%22network+management%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s
* Add some more modelers
	- port scanners
	- syslogs
* OpenId can be used to identify users. OpenAuth can be used to authenticate them.
